# News-Events-Expanded

The purpose of "News Events Expanded" is to enrich the existing lore content in the game Battletech (developed by Harebrained Schemes)
by introducing additional "events" that showcase the established lore, as published by the owners of the Battletech universe, 
throughout the game's progression in years. 
The primary focus has been to fill the gaps that have not been covered by other creators, specifically in 
the time period of the 3030s and the early 3040s.

Currently it adds 50+ news events betweens 3030 and 3040s. The planned content is to further expand on news item covering early 3040s.

Note that these additional events will only be triggered if you use a mod of the Battletech that expands the timeline of the game
such as "BattleTech Extended 3025-3061" which has been focus of this work.
