# News Events Expanded

The purpose of "News Events Expanded" is to enrich the existing lore content in the game Battletech (developed by Harebrained Schemes)
by introducing additional "events" that showcase the established lore, as published by the owners of the Battletech universe, 
throughout the game's progression in years. 
The primary focus has been to fill the gaps that have not been covered by other creators, specifically in 
the time period of the 3030s and the first half of 3040s. With update 1.5.0, 6 new articles have been added to year 3061.

Currently it adds almost 90 news events between 3030-3045 and 3061, with over 17 000+ words, covering political, military, industrial and technical events as they takes place according to the Battletech cannon.

Note that these additional events will only be triggered if you use a mod of the Battletech that expands the timeline of the game
such as ["BattleTech Extended 3025-3061"](https://discourse.modsinexile.com/t/battletech-extended-3025-3061-1-9-3-7/426) which has been focus of this work.

Finally, I would mention that I have dabbled into making of Flashpoints which build upon some of the news told through the in-game broadcasts - for those of you who want to see that side of the Battletech universe, I point you to my mod [Flashpoints of the Inner Sphere](https://github.com/Warenwolf/Flashpoints-of-the-Inner-Sphere).

**How to install:** 

The content in the extracted folders BT_Extended_CE and BT_Extended_Timeline go 
into equally named folders in "BATTLETECH\MODS\" folder (Your mod folder may be named differently).
