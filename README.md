# News Events Expanded

The purpose of "News Events Expanded" is to enrich the existing lore content in the game Battletech (developed by Harebrained Schemes)
by introducing additional "events" that showcase the established lore, as published by the owners of the Battletech universe, 
throughout the game's progression in years. 
The primary focus has been to fill the gaps that have not been covered by other creators, specifically in 
the time period of the 3030s and the first half of 3040s.

Currently it adds 80+ news events between 3030 and 3045s, with over 17 000+ words, covering political, military, industrial and technical events as they takes place according to the Battletech cannon.
