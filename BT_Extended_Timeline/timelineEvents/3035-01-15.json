The Ijori troops seemed to have managed to repel the attacks.",

The Capellans have claimed that the Black Widow Battalion used atomics with ComStar currently evaluating these claims.\r\n\r\nThe Black Widow Battalion followed up the explosion with a fierce attack on the 2nd Ijori battalion with their air supremacy turning the ensuing battle in favor of the Black Widow Battalion. The end result was 80% of the Ijori mechs being destroyed, with the remaining mechs being effective mission kill casualties. For all purposes, Warrior House Ijori has been eliminated as an effective fighting force.\r\n\r\nThe reports indicate that the mercenaries have left the planet soon after the battle was over. The goal of their invasion remains unclear at the moment.\r\n\r\nThis has been the CNB January broadcast.",
