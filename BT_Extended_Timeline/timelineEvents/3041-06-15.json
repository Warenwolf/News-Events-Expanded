At that moment, an unknown assailant fired at the Precentor's car from close range. Although wounded, Tejh managed to escape the scene and rendezvous with a [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreComGuards3030s],Com Guard]] rescue team.\r\n\r\nCurrently, she is receiving treatment on [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Terra],Terra]].",
