However, everything changed during the last two months.\r\n\r\nPitiless resistance and special operations by the [[DM.Factions[faction_LiaoA2],Capellan Death Commandos]], one of which even killed General Humphreys, daughter of Dame Humphreys from the Andurien, finally ground down the Andurian forces, leading to a general retreat.\r\n\r\nOn other fronts, the Andurian offensive is going much better, with the [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_SigmaMare],Sigma Mare]] system, an important logistical hub, falling easily to Andurian forces. Additionally, a significant portion of [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Betelgeuse],Betelgeuse]], including the Aldis weapons plant, has recently come under Andurian control.\r\n\r\nThis has been the CNB April broadcast.",
