The subsequent invasion of the [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Villanueva],Villanueva]] system was also reported as successful. Political pundits expected a quick follow-up, which indeed happened.\r\n\r\n[[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Shiro],Shiro III]] was attacked soon after, with three [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMarikFWLM],FWLM]] regiments operating on the planet: <i>Atrean Hussars, the 1st Marik Militia</i> and <i>the 1st Fusiliers of Oriente.</i>",

The Defenders managed to break the Marik lines but were prevented from achieving a total victory by the arrival of reinforcing [[DM.Factions[faction_MarikA2],1st Marik Militia]] and [[DM.Factions[faction_MarikA5],1st Fusiliers of Oriente]] formations. The <i>5th Defenders of Andurien</i> disengaged and left the theater on their dropships.\r\n\r\nFWLM formations then attacked the capital city, defended by the entrenched [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreDefendersOfAndurien],1st Defenders of Andurien]] regiment. Unlike the previous pitched fighting, Marik forces refused to launch a direct assault and instead opted to wear down the defenders. The Anduriens seemed to have decided that further defense was unlikely to produce a victory and retreated from the planet on June 7th.\r\n\r\nThis has been the CNB June broadcast.",
