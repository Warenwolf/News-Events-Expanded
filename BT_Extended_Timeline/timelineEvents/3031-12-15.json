It announces that [[DM.Factions[faction_BlackWidowCompany],Black Widow Company]], a semi-independent sub-unit of the famous <i>Wolf Dragoons</i>, has been upgraded to a battalion-sized unit (hence the new name) and is now available for hire.\r\n\r\nWhile the content of the holovideo doesn't differ much from the standard promotional material these days, what caught the attention of many is the higher-than-usual price tag and the preference for piece work over long-term contracts.",
