                        "Details": "The Battle of Lopez proved to be a challenging endeavor for FWL forces, as their battlemech advantage was offset by a significant number of rebel tank and infantry forces supporting the defending [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreDefendersOfAndurien],6th Defenders of Andurien]].\r\n\r\nThe FWLM employed a maneuvering battle strategy, leveraging the inherent mobility of their battlemechs to counter the rebels' numerical superiority. Despite the intense fighting that nearly escalated into a pitched battle, which the FWLM aimed to avoid, luck favored the loyalists at every turn. Finally, after three months of combat and mounting losses, the 6th Defenders decided to initiate a retreat from the planet.\r\n\r\nThis concludes the CNB November broadcast.",
