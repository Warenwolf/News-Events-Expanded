While raids are normally rapid and destructive affairs where raiders avoid pitched battles with local militia, the latest raids have seen an increase in violence and intensity.\r\n\r\nThe latest raid on Uhuru turned into a three-week pitched battle, resulting in the loss of a company of BattleMechs for each side, an almost unheard-of number of casualties for a simple raid.\r\n\r\nPolitical analysts are speculating that these raids may be a precursor to the Steiner-Davion alliance taking advantage of the Free Worlds League’s preoccupation with their war on their rebel province, the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreDuchyOfAndurien],Duchy of Andurien]].\r\n\r\nThis has been the CNB September broadcast.",
