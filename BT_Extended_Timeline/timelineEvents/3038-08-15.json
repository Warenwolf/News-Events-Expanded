The invaders swiftly neutralized the disorganized militia formations, with the highly mobile <i>4th Marik Militia</i> flanking them while the <i>2nd Marik Militia</i> pinned down the opposing formation. The combination of local numerical superiority and multi-sided attacks quickly eliminated the inexperienced rebel militia forces.\r\n\r\nThis concludes the CNB August broadcast.",
