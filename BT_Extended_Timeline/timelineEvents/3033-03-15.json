The two groups of invading mercenaries found themselves in positions where they could not support each other.\r\n\r\nHowever, through immediate aggressive actions of <i>Steel Eagles</i> and <i>Light Cavalry</i>, the lines of the <i>Black Widow Battalion</i> were pierced, and Natasha Kerensky chose to disengage at that point.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of this news report, the Capellan mercenaries are eliminating or taking control of logistic and support points in order to prevent the <i>Black Widow Battalion</i> from waging the guerrilla war of the type they did when they ejected the FWLM from Kujari and Wallacia last year.\r\n\r\nThis has been the CNB March broadcast.",
