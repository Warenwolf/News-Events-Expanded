She is widely recognized as a war hero among Canopians, thanks to her service in the 2nd Canopian Cuirassiers, particularly during the action on New Roland. \r\n\r\nHer courageous actions during the rearguard fighting prevented the total destruction of Canopian forces by the CCAF during the retreat from New Roland.\r\n\r\nThe 17th Magestrix will face significant challenges ahead, as the nation continues to recover from a devastating war and a prolonged economic downturn that has lasted for years.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis has been the CNB May broadcast.",
