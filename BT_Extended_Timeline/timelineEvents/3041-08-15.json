A few moments later, a huge explosion rocked the compound, completely disintegrating the outer wall and causing severe damage to the buildings. Five acolytes and two adepts were reported killed, while the Precentor of the KO station was seriously wounded and remains in critical condition.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the invaluable HPG Station remains unharmed.",
