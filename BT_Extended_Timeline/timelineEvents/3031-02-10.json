        "Details": "<b>St. Ives Compact to introduce new Vindicator variant?</b>\r\n\r\nAnonymous sources inside the military establishment of the [[DM.Factions[faction_Ives],St. Ives Compact]] are providing us with news about the government's plan to introduce a new variant of the Vindicator battlemech. The new variant, although not yet confirmed, is expected to be named the [[DM.MechDefs[mechdef_vindicator_VND-1SIC],Vindicator VND-1SIC]].\r\n\r\nThe Vindicator has a reputation for being an affordable and resilient medium mech, although it doesn't excel in any particular area. It has been predominantly used by the Capellan Confederation, deployed in almost every unit and role in the CCAF. However, it has been a rare sight outside the Confederation and among mercenaries, mainly due to the outrageous markup that Ceres Metals Industries imposes on parts sold outside the Confederation.",
