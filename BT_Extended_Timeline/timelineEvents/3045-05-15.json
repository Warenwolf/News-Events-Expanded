Interstellar Expeditions claims that the satellites are primarily intended for mapping and navigation purposes, essentially a rehashed version of a preâ€“Star League design used for exploration.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, the governments within the Inner Sphere are expressing discontent with this, particularly after uncovering the involvement of the Technology Transfer Division of Irian Technologies in the manufacturing process of the satellites. This association raises concerns due to Irian Technologies' recent media scandal involving allegations of industrial espionage.",
