This resolves the several months of political deadlock in the [[DM.Factions[faction_Marik],Free Worlds League]] that ensued after the current Captain-General Janos Marik suffered a severe stroke, rendering him unable to fulfill his duty as Captain-General.",

Members of Parliament were divided in their support for either the son of Janos, Duggan Marik, or his nephew Duncan Marik, with neither contender able to secure a majority.\r\n\r\nAfter today’s presentation of his claim and the supporting evidence, Thomas Marik has garnered support from the majority of Parliament, including some of the most influential figures in the [[DM.Factions[faction_Marik],Free Worlds League]]: Duke Halas, MP Shane Eastwick, and SAFE director Jaime Cornel.\r\n\r\nParliament has bestowed upon Thomas Marik the title of “Warden of the Perimeter Defenses,” while his father retains the title of Captain-General.\r\n\r\nThis concludes the CNB January broadcast.",
