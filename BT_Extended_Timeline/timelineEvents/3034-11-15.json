His surrender signaled the surrender of the rest of the Ronin forces on the planet.\r\n\r\nWith this surrender there are no significant Ronin forces remaining in this war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Andurien Crisis is still ongoing, with [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_NewRoland],New Roland]] invaded by [[DM.Factions[faction_LiaoA4],Warrior House Dai Da Chi]] and [[DM.Factions[faction_LiaoC10],Kamakura's Hussars]]. Many outside observers consider a Capellan victory almost certain.\r\n\r\nThis has been the CNB November broadcast.",
