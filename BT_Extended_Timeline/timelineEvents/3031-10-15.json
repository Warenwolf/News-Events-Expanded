With the recent deaths of Major James Humphreys and General Mildred Humphreys in March, the war has now claimed the lives of two of Dame Humphreys' children.",

The balance of power briefly shifted to the defenders' side when [[DM.Factions[faction_LiaoA6],Warrior House Hiritsu]] joined the defenders in July by hot dropping into Andurian rear areas, causing considerable chaos. This forced General Garibaldi to detach forces for search and destroy missions to counter <i>Hirutsu</i>'s rampage.\r\n\r\nDuring one of those search and destroy missions, Major Humphreys' command company encountered an enemy detachment. The clash was short and brutal, resulting in significant losses on both sides.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the Major's cockpit was crushed when his crippled Mech fell.\r\n\r\nDame Humphreys stated that her son's death would not be in vain and that significant forces would be committed to ensure Betelgeuse's incorporation into Andurien.\r\n\r\nThis has been the CNB October broadcast.",
