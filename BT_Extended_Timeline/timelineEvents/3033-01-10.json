The four medium lasers armament is for dealing with enemies who survive the LRM rain and the fire of supporting units.\r\n\r\n[[DM.Factions[faction_Kurita],House Kurita]] has completely changed the role of the Catapult with their [[DM.MechDefs[mechdef_catapult_CPLT-K2],CPLT-K2]] variant. It replaces the launchers with PPCs and the side torso lasers with machine guns. The jump jets were removed in favor of heat sinks, making it more of a direct fire support unit.\r\n\r\nThis has been the CNB January broadcast.",
