Naturally, given the two systems’ strategic positions on Andurien’s border, Thomas Marik ordered immediate reaction. FWLM <i>Second Oriente Hussars </i> have completed their occupation of Wallacia and are about to move on Kujari.\r\n\r\nCapellans have confirmed their last month’s success in retaking [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Primus],Primus]] and [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Prix],Prix]] planets. Recently Andurians also gave up their long fight for [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Gunthar],Gunthar]] departing the system on 9 July and have finally admitted to have failed in their attack on [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Turin],Turin]] back in April.",
