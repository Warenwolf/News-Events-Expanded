However, invading [[DM.Factions[faction_LiaoC8],Kincade's Rangers]] received reinforcements on the 10th of this month by [[DM.Factions[faction_LiaoA4],Warrior House Dai Da Chi]]. Both units had previously fought together on Drozan, and their coordination was excellent.\r\n\r\nThis immediately changed the situation on the ground, and according to the latest reports, Canopian forces are now retreating from the system.",

Considering the casualties Canopians suffered in the battles of Drozan and Gunthar last year, analysts speculate that the Canopians do not have enough reserve troops to turn the situation in Repulse.\r\n\r\nThis has been the CNB July broadcast.",
