Despite the victory the bloody fighting has reduced both FWLM and Andurian forces involved.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven more bloody Battle of [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Xanthe],Xanthe III]] ended on 5th of May, in FWLM's favor after the later brought in superior number of forces on the planet. Currently Andurien forces are fighting rearguard actions while evacuating from the system.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother great blow to Duchy of Andurian and indicative of the overall situation for the Duchy, is that [[DM.Factions[faction_Merc11],Tooth of Ymir]] mercenary company in their employ since 3030 and cornerstone of many battles, declined to extend their employment with the Duchy.",
