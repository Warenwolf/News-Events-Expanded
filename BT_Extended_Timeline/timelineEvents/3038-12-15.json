With Conquista no longer a threat, only two worlds remain of the Duchy of Andurien - [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Lurgatan],Lurgatan]], which is tactically and strategically irrelevant, and [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Andurien],Andurien]] itself, where all the remaining Andurien forces are gathered and where the final battle of the war will be fought.",
