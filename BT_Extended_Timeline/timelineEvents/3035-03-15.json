The Canopian-Andurien alliance has been losing ground ever since.",

These riots, seemingly triggered by the ceding of planets and territories captured in the Fourth Succession War to the newly established Rasalhague Republic, are thought by many experts to be related to dissatisfaction with the political union between Houses Steiner and Davion. Regardless of the reason, this presents a political headache to the political elites in the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis has been the CNB April broadcast.",
