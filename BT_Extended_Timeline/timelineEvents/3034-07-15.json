Who the culprit is still unknown. The heavy mechs of Republican forces have initially scattered lighter mechs of Ronins but are struggling in maneuver warfare that ensued.\r\n\r\n[[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Rasalhague],Rasalhague]] planet is reported totally free from Ronin forces and DCMS have eliminated Ronin forces on [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Engadin],Engadin]].\r\n\r\nOn June 15th [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Bruben],Bruben]] was also completely liberated by mercenary troops who eliminated Ronins that had entrenched themselves in a local fortress. On the other hand costly assault decimated the pro-republican mercenaries.\r\n\r\nRonins on [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Memmingen],Memmingen]] had established a military junta after their takeover which functioned until DCMS First Sword of Light invaded in the beginning of July. After a few ritual duels, Ronins have opted for guerrilla warfare.\r\n\r\nBattle for [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Orestes],Orestes]] has also been pacified after [[DM.Factions[faction_Rasalhague1],Drak√∏ns]], assisted by the mercenary units <i>Legion of the Rising Sun</i> and the <i>Dismal Disinherited</i>, invaded late June. After a deal with Ronin Night Stalkers unit facilitating evacuation of Combine citizenry, this unit surrendered. With now substantial numerical advantage Republicans defeated the remaining Ronins after a short fight.",
