Although they were originally installed in mechs by the Terran Hegemony, they gradually fell out of fashion centuries ago. Nowadays, they can only be found on a few remaining heirloom mechs.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn comparison, LRM (Long-Range Missiles) systems, while having a similar mass to mortars  and despite utilizing more expensive ammunition, are capable of delivering greater firepower over a shorter period of time. Additionally, LRMs offer the advantage of being able to fire both directly and indirectly at the target.",
