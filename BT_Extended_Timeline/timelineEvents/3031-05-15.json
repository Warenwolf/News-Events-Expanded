                        "Details": "The Renegades' raid on the 9th of May was lightning fast. Initially, some residents mistook the raiders for the vanguard of Candace Liao, who had returned to the Confederacy in order to take the Celestial Throne - an easy mistake for rash minds to make, considering that the planet is bordering [[DM.Factions[faction_Ives],St. Ives Compact’s]] territory. This resulted in some initial celebrations, but citizens soon realized their mistake. The Renegades, their mission complete, were soon boosting for orbit.\r\n\r\nThe <i>Fifth Defenders</i>' raid on [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Jasmine],Jasmine]] was a somewhat more violent ten-day operation. The Fifth Defenders easily suppressed the local air forces and managed to beat back attacks from <i>Warrior House Ijori</i>, which is still decimated from losses suffered in the 4th Succession War.\r\n\r\nThe <i>Fifth Defenders</i> managed to seize large quantities of medical supplies and machinery, which they loaded onto a number of captured civilian DropShips before leaving the planet.\r\n\r\nSome pundits have been speculating that the anemic responses from CCAF to these raids are indicative of the horrific losses the Capellans have suffered in recent wars.\r\n\r\nThis has been the CNB May broadcast.",
