During the lightning-fast attack, Steele managed to reach his Marauder and challenged Col. Natasha Kerensky, piloting her signature Warhammer, to a duel.\r\n\r\n[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreBlackWidow],Natasha Kerensky]] accepted the challenge. She got the upper hand during the duel and called out to Steele to surrender personally, and his battalion to follow soon. Steele complied, and his forces followed. According to the latest reports, Kujari's control has reverted to its civilian administration.\r\n\r\nThis has been the CNB April broadcast.",
