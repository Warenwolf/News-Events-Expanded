It remains unclear whether this is the rumored corrosive coolant variant or another solution the St. Ives engineers opted for.",

                        "Details": "Moving on to Coventry system, a far more radical medium mech packed with the latest technology is currently being rolled out by Coventry Metal Works.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix Hawk 3S model, [[DM.MechDefs[mechdef_phoenixhawk_PXH-3S],PXH-3S]], has upgraded armor, which has being replaced with Lexington Limited High-Grade [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreFF],Ferro-Fibrous]] armor. Additionally, its engine has being upgraded to an [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreXL],extralight]] Pitban Fusion Engine version. At the same time, the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMASC], MASC]] grants it the ability to periodically boost its speed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIts left torso is equipped with cellular ammunition storage equipment ([[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreCASE],CASE]]), greatly improving the pilot and machine's survivability. It even features an active protection system in the form of an [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreAMS],AMS]] installation in its arm. The PXH-3S is armed with a Thunderbolt-12 Large Pulse Laser as its main weapon, supported by a pair of medium lasers and machine guns.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe downside of cramming every new technology under the sun into a mech of this size is, of course, that the price of this medium mech may very well rival the current market price of some assault-class mechs. Our in-house experts doubt that the PXH-3S will become as ubiquitous as the venerable PHX-1 design is today. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>January 3042 Edition of DBC Monthly News Recap: Stay in the Know!</i>",
