Raid into Second Try is bit harder to fathom, since provoking Steiner-Davion alliance can seem on surface to be counterproductive for FWL, seeing its internal troubles and Andurian Crises they have to deal with.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to FWL troubles in Kujari and Wallacia, the <i>Second Oriente Hussars’</i>  troubles started when they on their landing on Kujari met fierce opposition from mercenaries local authorities had hired - [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreBlackWidow],Natasha Kerensky's]] <i>Black Widow Battalion</i>.\r\n\r\nThrough next few days much of FWL forces would be whittled down in series of hit and run attacks, finally being forced from Kujari with Black Widow taking the fight to Wallacia.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis has been the CNB September broadcast.",
