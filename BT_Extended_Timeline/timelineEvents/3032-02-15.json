Whether it was a raid or a conquest is unknown at this point. Analyzing the initial drop point locations, which were too far from each other to provide mutual support, it is safe to assume that the invaders did not regard the local defenses highly.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, they were met by the formidable Black Widow Battalion led by [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreBlackWidow],Col. Natasha Kerensky]] herself.",

Apparently, even some of the Guards’ DropShips have been captured.\r\n\r\nReports from the Federated Suns indicate that deserting Free Worlds League soldiers belonging to the 4th Free World Guards are asking for political asylum. These sources imply that the unit in question has been decimated.\r\n\r\nAs far as we know, this is the first contract that the Black Widow Battalion received after becoming active barely two months ago.\r\n\r\nThis has been the CNB February broadcast.",
