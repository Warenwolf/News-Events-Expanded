She tragically died in the fighting that broke out later that day but is already being hailed as a martyr throughout the Tamar Pact region of the Commonwealth.",

Details are not yet clear, but witnesses confirm that rebel DCMS troops attacked first.\r\n\r\nThe Rebel 9th Rasalhague Regulars invaded [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Engadin],Engadin]], killing most of the new planetary officials before declaring martial law.\r\n\r\nSimilar events are also happening in [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Predlitz],Predlitz]], [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Heiligendreuz],Heiligendreuz]], and [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Memmingen],Memmingen]]. In Memmingen, rebels even tried to seize the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreHPG],HPG]] compound, forcing a ComStar DropShip to provide defense to repel the attack.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest crime happened in [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Trondheim(DC)],Trondheim]], where three thousand people died in the six-hour artillery barrage of the ancient city by the rebelling DCMS forces. This attack has outraged the public and inflamed emotions throughout the new state.\r\n\r\nThis event has also been a catalyst for accelerating the rate of Rasalhague natives leaving DCMS units to join the KungsArm√©, the newly formed armed forces of the Free Rasalhague Republic.\r\n\r\nThis has been the CNB April broadcast.",
