        "Details": "<b>The usage of the new Grasshopper field variant is becoming more widespread</b>\r\n\r\n\r\nMany pilots have tinkered with their Grasshoppers over the centuries, but none have managed to find a decidedly better configuration of the original [[DM.MechDefs[mechdef_grasshopper_GHR-5H],GHR-5H]].\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal combination of a heavy Mingh z33/7 mech chassis and 4 Leviathon Lifters jump jets have produced a highly mobile weapon platform that is highly mission flexible. While somewhat weakly armored compared to designs of similar weight, this is offset by clever design and weapon placement, with main weapon, a Diplan HD Large Laser positioned in the torso, allowing Grasshopper to fire its main weapon even with heavy damage to its arms and torso sides.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the large laser mentioned above, Grasshopper sports additional four Diplan M3 Medium Lasers and a Conan/S LRM 5 missile bank.
