    "Name" : " Extralight Fusion Engine",
    "Details" : "The XL fusion engine, short for extralight fusion engine, shares a mechanical resemblance with a regular fusion engine but incorporates significantly lighter radiation shielding. By substituting the dense tungsten carbide with a crystalline polymer, the XL fusion engine achieves the same performance while weighing only half as much.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there is a drawback in terms of size. In comparison to a standard fusion engine, the Inner Sphere XL fusion engines is twice as large, resulting in increased bulkiness and protrusion into side torso area.\r\n\r\nDeveloped by Terran Hegemony scientists in 2556, these power plants first saw operative use by their armed forces in 2579.\r\n\r\nHowever, the destructive nature of the Succession Wars led to the demise of the final XL engine manufacturing plant by 2865. Consequently, the technology remained absent within the Inner Sphere until its rediscovery by the Lyran Commonwealth in 3035.",
