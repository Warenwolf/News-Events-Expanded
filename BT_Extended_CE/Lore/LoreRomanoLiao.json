    "Name" : "Romano Liao",
    "Details" : "Romano Liao, the second daughter of Chancellor Maximilian Liao, took over as regent after the Capellan Confederation was left devastated by the Fourth Succession War, which had a profound impact on Maximilian's sanity. Barely two years later, another war erupted as the Duchy of Andurien and the Magistracy of Canopus launched a joint invasion. Despite the demoralized state of the nation and military, Romano rallied them and successfully repelled the invaders.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Maximilian Liao took his own life on April 21, 3036, Romano ascended as Chancellor on May 12 of the same year. Empowered with complete authority as the sovereign of the realm, she embarked on a thorough reorganization of the Confederation according to her own vision. She purged the Maskirovka, the intelligence agency, and appointed Tsen Shang, her long-time lover, as its director. Romano further consolidating her power within the Confederation, quickly ensuring that the military, intelligence services, and assassins guild were all loyal to her, warding off any potential threats. \r\n\r\n\r\nChancellor Liao's extreme paranoia stems, in part, from the ease with which spies like Justin Allard infiltrated the Confederation during her father's reign. Sometimes during bouts of paranoia she resorts to implanting tracking chips in the heads of palace staff or killing them altogether. Though considered mentally unstable, her brilliance and determination cannot be denied.",
