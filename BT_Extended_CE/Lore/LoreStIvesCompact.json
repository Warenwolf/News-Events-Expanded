    "Details" : "The Compact came into existence in 3029 following the Fourth Succession War. Duchess Candace Liao, the eldest child and heir of Chancellor Maximilian Liao, developed a romantic relationship with Justin Xiang Allard, a Federated Suns spy embedded in the Capellan Confederation's intelligence agency, the Maskirovka. Instead of remaining in the Capellan Confederation with a double-agent involved in the conquest of a third of her homeland, she chose to escape with her lover, taking the St. Ives Commonality with her.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince then, the Capellan Confederation has been biding its time, awaiting an opportunity to recapture the rebellious province.",
