    "Name" : "Archon Prince Victor Steiner-Davion",
    "Details" : "Victor Ian Steiner-Davion, the eldest son of Prince Hanse Davion and Archon Melissa Steiner-Davion, grew up under the immense expectations set by his renowned parents. From childhood, he absorbed tales of his father's heroic deeds against the Capellan Confederation and the Draconis Combine, while his mother's popularity as an Archon added to the weight of their legacy.\r\n\r\nComing of age during the Clan invasion, Victor played a pivotal role in leading the Federated Commonwealth to its initial victories against the Clans. Following the deaths of his father in 3052 and his mother in 3055, Victor ascended to the united Federated Commonwealth throne at the age of twenty-five.\r\n\r\nHis lack of experience became evident when his bold Operation Gemini failed, paving the way for the Marik-Liao joint Operation Guerrero. This reversal undid his father's achievements in the 4th Succession War and ultimately resulted in the destruction of the Federated Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nHis drive to free the Inner Sphere from the threat of the Clans, led him to ignore his sister's betrayal and while his attention was on Operation BULLDOG his duplicitous sister Katherine eventually usurped his throne.",
