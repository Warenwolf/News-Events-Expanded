    "Name" : "Anti-Missile Systems",
    "Details" : "Introduced in 2617 by the Terran Hegemony, the anti-missile system was used to destroy missiles before they struck their target. This was accomplished by using a short-ranged rapid firing weapon which shot at the missiles. Because missiles were usually fired in salvos of up to forty at a time, anti-missile systems were rarely capable of destroying them all but still mitigated the damage missile bombardment caused. Due to the loss of knowledge caused by the Succession Wars, anti-missile systems ceased to be produced by 2835.\r\n\r\nAMS was considered Lostech until Federated Suns rediscovered the ability to manufacture anti-missile systems in 3040.
