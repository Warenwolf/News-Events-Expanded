    "Details" : "Introduced in 2740 by the Terran Hegemony, the Myomer Accelerator Signal Circuitry (MASC) is a device that enables a BattleMech to achieve double its normal walking speed. However, the actuators were not originally designed to endure such stress, as they were sized for regular operations during the design phase. Consequently, prolonged usage of MASC systems can result in damage to the leg actuators of a BattleMech. Although this may not completely immobilize the BattleMech, the risk of actuators being destroyed is significant enough for cautious MechWarriors to limit the use of MASC systems in battle, employing them only intermittently.\r\n\r\nConsidered a piece of Lostech for many years, the Capellan Confederation revived the technology and reintroduced MASC in 3035.
