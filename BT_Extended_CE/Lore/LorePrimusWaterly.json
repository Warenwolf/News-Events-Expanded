    "Details" : "The rise to power of Myndo Waterly, the current leader of ComStar, was one of the most turbulent and controversial in the organization's history. A Draconis Combine native, Myndo Waterly was a gifted student who caught the attention of the ISF and O5P, who sponsored her education. However, her studies were abruptly cut short when she clashed with the Combine authorities, leading her to join ComStar.\r\n\r\nWaterly swiftly and ruthlessly climbed the ranks of the organization, stirring up controversy due to the rapidity of her promotions and her radical and militant interpretation of Jerome Blake's writings.\r\n\r\nIn 3029, she ultimately became the Primus of ComStar.",
