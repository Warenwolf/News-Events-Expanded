    "Details" : "CASE, short for Cellular Ammunition Storage Equipment, was pioneered by the Terran Hegemony in 2452 initially in order to prevent the complete destruction of a unit in the event of an internal explosion by channeling the excess pressure outside the CASE containment. This minimises internal damage and prevents sympathetic detonations.\r\n\r\nConsidered a piece of Lostech since 2840, the Capellan Confederation rediscovered the technology and reintroduced CASE in 3035.",
