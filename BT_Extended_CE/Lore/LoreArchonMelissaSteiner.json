    "Name" : "Archon Melissa Arthur Steiner",
    "Details" : "Daughter of Katrina Steiner and Arthur Luvon and the wife of Hanse Davion. Curret Archon of the Lyran half of the Federated Commonwealth Alliance. Trained as infantry commander but showed an aversion to war and the military in her youth. She still proved able commander when stranded on Styx mining base, ably defending it against a coordinated assault by both ISF forces and the Genyosha mech forces. \r\n\r\n\r\nHer weddding is famously known as the signal to start the 4th Succesion War, catching the rest of the Inner Sphere off-guard.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe loves the Federated Commonwealth and is putting great effort into overcoming the divisions between the Davion and Lyrian halfs. In turn she is very popular figure among the public in both halfs of the Federated Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nObservers consider her a better politician and administrator than Hanse which is no small accolade having in mind reasons behind Hanse Davion nickname -\"The Fox\".",
